# Interviewtask

Intellij IDE used along with Kotlin & KTOR.

Competed things:

The work done till fetching content from API, parsing it & storing it into an Object class. However, the SQL connection along with tables of the related classes are also created.
Thus, to run the project. The SQL connection must be made otherwise it would be showing an error.

InComplete things:

1- Storing data into a database & generating queries.
2- Using the generated queries to POST the content.

NOTE: It was mandatory to POST only after the queries has been implemented. So, did not do it earlier.

Instructions related to SQL connection.

1- The XAAMP server was used. So, from the XAAMP control pannel start an Apache & SQL server.
2- Create tables in localhost server.
3- Run the project.

Please, ask any question if you have. 

Thanks.
